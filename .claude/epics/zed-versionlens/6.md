# Task: Inline Badge UI

## Description
Display version comparison inline in the editor using Zed's decoration API.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Show inline badge on dependency lines (e.g., "^1.2.3 → 1.4.0")
- [ ] Color code: green for up-to-date, yellow for outdated, red for major version diff
- [ ] Only show badges when package file is the active buffer
- [ ] Debounce to avoid excessive API calls

## Technical Details
- Use Zed's decoration/appearance API
- Query registry after file opens (with debounce)
- Compare current version with latest (use semver crate)
- Show "up to date" or "outdated" indicator

## Dependencies

- Task 5: npm Registry Client

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 5
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
