# Task: Package Parsing

## Description
Implement parsing for package file formats to extract dependencies. Start with package.json (tree-sitter), then add others.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parse package.json dependencies using tree-sitter (JSON)
- [ ] Extract dependency names and version specifiers
- [ ] Support all dependency sections: dependencies, devDependencies, peerDependencies
- [ ] Return list of (name, version_specifier, line_number) for each dependency

## Technical Details
- Use Zed's built-in tree-sitter for JSON parsing
- Reference package-version-server for tree-sitter query pattern
- Create a trait for package parsers to support multiple formats
- Focus on npm first (package.json), others can be simpler regex

## Dependencies
- Task 3: Extension Setup

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tested with sample package.json
